# Adverity Outlier Detection

This repository contains code for two take-home tasks that were assigned to me as part of the recruitment process.

I've split the repo as following:
```
├───data
│   └───avazu-ctr-prediction
├───plots
├───src
└───tests
```

where `data` folder contains files downloaded from Kaggle, <br>
`plots` contains the graphs produced during the analysis, <br>
`src` stores the jupyter notebook files - <br> each for a particular task being solved, <br> and 
finally, `tests` - which have simple tests as you wished
